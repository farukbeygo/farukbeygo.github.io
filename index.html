                      <p class="card-text">Abstract: This talk gravitates around the three forms of the spectral theorem 
                        for normal operators in Hilbert spaces. We will start from the geometry of conic sections that 
                        has it origin back in the classical Greek geometry and travel through the mathematical models for 
                        natural sciences that are related to ordinary and partial differential equations, the roots of functional 
                        analysis and of operator theory, and end with the mathematical models for quantum mechanics. On the way, 
                        we will illustrate how the spectral theorem was gradually understood and eventually took its triple form 
                        and how it clarified questions in these disciplines. In our journey we will encounter many of the most famous 
                        mathematicians and scientists and point out their remarkable contributions to mathematics and to the 
                        quest of understanding the universe in which we live.</p>

                        Math Talk Series: What is, and what should be, local structure of symmetries?
                      </h5>
                      <p class="card-text">Abstract: One of the key ideas of 19th century mathematics, 
                        emerging gradually over several decades, was that, after starting with an object 
                        that has some symmetry, one can usefully forget the object and retain only the abstract 
                        symmetry, which is called a group. At present, one of the aims in group theory is to try 
                        to forget the group and to retain only its so-called local structure. It is an open 
                        question as to quite what the local structure ought to be. We shall be indicating one 
                        approach to this.
  
                        The talk is intended to be accessible to all mathematics undergraduates who have had
                        some experience of the notion of a mathematical object as a set equipped with some structure
                        such as a multiplication operation or a partial ordering relation. My intention is just
                        to give an impressionistic indication of what kind of thing we study and how we study it
                        when doing mathematical research.</p>
